## Monitoring Infrastructure with Prometheus and Grafana

###  Introduction

In today's dynamic and fast-paced technological landscape, monitoring is an essential aspect of maintaining the health and performance of software applications and infrastructure. Prometheus and Grafana are two powerful open-source tools that have become industry standards for monitoring and visualizing system metrics.

**Prometheus** is a robust and flexible monitoring system that excels at collecting and querying time-series data. It is designed for reliability and scalability, making it an ideal choice for monitoring complex, distributed systems.

**Grafana** complements Prometheus by providing a rich and customizable platform for visualizing and analyzing metrics. With Grafana, users can create interactive and informative dashboards, making it easier to understand and respond to the behavior of their systems.

  

### Motivation

The motivation behind this repository is to provide a template that simplifies the process of integrating Prometheus and Grafana into any project. Monitoring should be an integral part of every development project, and this template aims to streamline the setup process, allowing developers to focus on building their applications while ensuring they have robust monitoring in place.

### Quick Start Guide

To quickly set up the monitoring infrastructure, follow these steps:

 1. Install Prerequisites:
	  - Ensure you have Node.js version 18 or above installed. 
	 - Install Docker on your system.
2. Clone the repository
    ```
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/monitoring-template.git
    ```
4. Install NPM Packages
    ```
	npm install
    ```
5. Run Docker Compose
	````
	cd docker
	docker-compose up -d
	````
6. Access Grafana
	-   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
	-   Use the following credentials to log in:
	    -   Username: admin
	    -   Password: admin
7. Access Prometheus
	- Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/)

Now, your monitoring infrastructure is up and running. Feel free to explore Grafana dashboards and Prometheus metrics to gain insights into your system's performance.

### Additional Information

-   **Grafana Dashboard:** Customize Grafana dashboards based on your project's metrics.
-   **Alerting Rules:** Configure alerting rules in Prometheus to receive notifications for specific conditions.
-   **Exporter Configuration:** Adjust exporter configurations in the Docker Compose file to monitor additional services.

By using this template, you can seamlessly integrate monitoring into your projects, ensuring better visibility and control over your system's health.
